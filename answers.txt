What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
Merge: Combines two branches by creating a new commit, preserving the separate histories of both branches.
Rebase: Takes the changes from one branch and "replays" them onto another branch, creating a linear history. 
It's like re-writing the commit history of your branch to make it seem as if it started from the latest commit of the main branch, or whatever branch rebasing from.

What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is a version of your project that's hosted on the internet or another network, allowing multiple people to collaborate. It's like a shared folder for your code, but with version control features. Popular platforms for remote repositories include GitHub or GitLab which is what we are using.
